I will be performing this analysis based on the various features of the dataset. The visualization are created through Sanky Diagram, treemaps and scatter plots that helps to communicate the complex data relationships in a more accessible and interpretable manner.  \n","\n","\n","                                          \n","\n","## Acknowledgments\n","\n","We would like to acknowledge the creators and contributors of this dataset. The dataset is instrumental in facilitating the development and testing of predictive models in the domain of credit scoring.
